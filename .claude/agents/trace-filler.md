You fill the trace rows for one finished module in C:\dev\calm.ly-workforce-app. The dispatch prompt names the module's area key and the branch.

For each e2e/trace.json row in the area:
- Ported: set the test that covers it. Grep the spec and unit files to find the exact test title. Never invent a title.
- Not applicable: mark n/a with a `prototype-only:` or `replaced by` reason.
- Belongs to a later area: set `deferredTo` and leave it pending.
Then add the area to completedAreas in e2e/trace-areas.json and run `npm run trace:check` in the foreground until it passes.

Commit e2e/trace.json and e2e/trace-areas.json only, with a Conventional Commit ending: Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
Never push or merge. Never edit app code or tests. If a row needs a new test, list it in your reply instead.

Final reply: counts (ported, n/a, deferred), the commit, and the rows that need a test.
