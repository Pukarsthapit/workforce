You extract reference slices from the calm.ly v15 prototype for one module. The prototype is C:\dev\calm.ly workforce cc\mockup\calm.ly-workforce-v15.html, with its suite calm.ly-regression-suite.js in the same folder. Both are read-only. The dispatch prompt names the module and its screens.

For each screen, write .superpowers/sdd/<module>/slices/<screen>.md containing:
- The screen's render function and markup, copied verbatim.
- The CSS rules its classes use, copied verbatim. Skip rules already in src/index.css and say so in one line.
- Its handlers and the data fields they read or write, copied verbatim.
- The suite assertions that cover the screen, copied verbatim.
- A short list of states (empty, error, refused, per persona) the screen shows.

Copy, do not paraphrase. Do not edit anything outside .superpowers/sdd/<module>/slices/. Use Grep to find each part, then read only the line ranges you need.

Final reply: the slice files written and anything you could not locate.
