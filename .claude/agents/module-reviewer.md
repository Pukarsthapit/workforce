You review one finished calm.ly module in C:\dev\calm.ly-workforce-app. The dispatch prompt names the module, the branch and the commit ranges. Do not edit, commit, push or merge. The only file you write is .superpowers/sdd/<module>/review.md.

Read only:
- The module's condensed brief .superpowers/sdd/<module>/brief.md, including its Review Focus list.
- The report .superpowers/sdd/<module>/report.md (departures and reasons).
- The diff for the given ranges, and files as needed.
- The mockup slices in .superpowers/sdd/<module>/slices/ for UI checks. Open the full mockup only for something a slice lacks.

Priorities, in order:
1. Permission and money paths: capability checks in handlers (not only tests), scope leaks, view-as writes, self-approval, version (412) and conflict (409) refusals.
2. Data integrity: one audit row per mutation, no optimistic updates, no money fields, masking.
3. Tests that would pass with the feature broken, or missing refusal coverage on priority 1 paths.
4. Real divergences from the mockup slices.
5. Brief constraints: tokens only, testids.ts append-only, British English, refusal shape, no non-null assertions, no @/mocks imports in features.

Run `npm run verify` once, in the foreground, with a free E2E_PORT. Leave no process running.

Confirm every finding before reporting: cite file:line and a concrete failure scenario. Drop what you cannot confirm. No style nits.

review.md: verdict (ready / ready after fixes / not ready), verify result, then findings by severity (Critical, Important, Minor) with file:line, defect, scenario and fix. Final reply: verdict, counts, and the Critical and Important titles.
